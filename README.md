# UBIRCH client (go)

The UBIRCH client provides signature and chaining services to seal original data generated on-premise. It takes care of
packaging the hashed data into a chained *UBIRCH PROTOCOL PACKET ("UPP")*, signing the package and sending it to the
UBIRCH backend for storage, anchoring in the blockchain, and as a source for verification requests.

*The original data must be stored in a customer database to be able to execute verification requests at a later stage.
UBIRCH does not store any original sensitive data!*

UPP data is sent to the UBIRCH client via HTTP requests. The client can receive either the original data as a JSON data
package which will be formatted and hashed (SHA256) by the client, or the binary representation of a SHA256 hash that is
directly added as payload to the UPP.

The UBIRCH client is able to handle multiple cryptographic identities (i.e. for multiple LAN based devices).
For each identity, the signing key and the signature of the last UPP are stored persistently to ensure an intact chain
after a restart.

## Dockerized UBIRCH client

The UBIRCH client is provided as a multi-architecture docker image that can be configured and run on any system that can
run docker (Intel/AMD64 or ARM64 architecture).

Docker Hub Address: [ubirch/ubirch-client](https://hub.docker.com/r/ubirch/ubirch-client)
> See how to [run client in Docker container](#run-client-in-docker-container)

[Jump to Quick Start](#quick-start)

### Requirements

- System based on Intel/AMD64 or ARM
- Docker installation
- Space to store last used signatures and key material, either:
    - disk space, mounted into the docker pod, or
    - as SQL database
- Possibility to send a HTTP request to UBIRCH.com domains
- A unique identifier (UUID) registered with the UBIRCH console
- A corresponding authentication token (acquired via UBIRCH console)
- A password for the clientâ€™s key store
- (OPTIONAL) a private ECDSA (ecdsa-prime256v1) key
  *(otherwise a new key is generated by the client itself)*

## Building

There are multiple make targets, to simplify the building process.

```shell
make           # default target: build
make all       # create all available artifacts
make build     # create all supported binaries
make pack      # compresses the binaries to be much smaller (requires UPX installation)
make image     # create docker image
make publish   # builds images for amd64 armv7 and arm64, publishes under versioned tag
               # takes IMAGE_TAG= to specify a different tag name
make clean     # delete all artifacts
```

Compiled artifacts will be saved to the `build/` directory.

```shell
make publish IMAGE_TAG=stable # will tag a multi-arch image with the selected tag and upload it
                              # to the dockerhub.
```

## Configuration

The configuration can be set via a configuration file (`config.json`) or environment variables.

There are three mandatory configurations:

1. a DSN to connect to a postgreSQL database, where the protocol context (i.e. keys, previous signatures, auth
   tokens) can be stored
2. a 32 byte base64 encoded secret, which will be used to encrypt the signing keys
3. a static authentication token to protect the registration endpoint

> You can generate a random 32 byte base64 encoded secret in a Linux/macOS terminal
> with `head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64`

At start-up, the client will first check if the `UBIRCH_SECRET32` environment variable exists and, if it does exist,
load the configuration from the environment variables. If the `UBIRCH_SECRET32` environment variable is not set or
empty, the client will try to load the `config.json`-file from the working directory. If neither exist, the client will
abort and exit.

### File Based Configuration

`config.json`:

```json
{
  "postgresDSN": "postgres://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:5432/<database>",
  "secret32": "<32 byte secret (base64 encoded)>",
  "registerAuth": "<static auth token for register endpoint>"
}
```

> See [example_config.json](main/config/example_config.json) as an example for file-based configuration.

### Environment Based Configuration

```shell
UBIRCH_POSTGRES_DSN=postgres://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:5432/<database>
UBIRCH_SECRET32=<32 byte secret (base64 encoded)>
UBIRCH_REGISTERAUTH=<static auth token for register endpoint>
```

> See [example.env](main/config/example.env) as an example for environment-based configuration.

All further configuration parameters have default values, that can be changed as described
under [Optional Configurations](#optional-configurations).

## Identity Initialization

The UBIRCH client is able to handle multiple cryptographic identities.
An identity has a universally unique identifier (UUID), private and public key, and an auth token.
Before signing requests can be processed, an identity has to be initialized.

The initialization consists of three parts:

- key generation (ECDSA)
- public key registration at the UBIRCH backend
- storing of the context in the database

The initialization can be triggered via [HTTP request](#identity-registration)
or [configuration](#identity-initialization-via-configuration).

Either way, the first step is to register the identity's UUID with the UBIRCH backend
and acquire an authentication token.

> A UUID can easily be generated in a Linux/macOS terminal with the `uuidgen` command.

### How to acquire the UBIRCH backend authentication token

- Create an account at the [**UBIRCH web UI**](https://console.prod.ubirch.com/) and log in.
- Go to **Things** (in the menu on the left) and click the green `+ ADD NEW DEVICE`-button.
- Enter your UUID to the **ID** field and, optionally, a description. Then click on `register`.
- After successful registration, you can click on your UUID to open the settings and copy the **"password"** (which
  looks like a UUID) from the `apiConfig`. This is the UBIRCH backend authentication token for your device.

### Identity initialization via configuration

It is possible to declare identities (devices) in the configuration with a `devices`-map, which maps device UUIDs to
their authentication token.

- add the `devices`-map to your `config.json`-file:
  ```json
    "devices": {
      "<UUID>": "<ubirch backend auth token>",
      "<another UUID>": "<another ubirch backend auth token>"
    }
  ```
- or as environment variable:
    ```shell
    UBIRCH_DEVICES=<UUID>:<ubirch backend auth token>,<another UUID>:<another ubirch backend auth token>
    ```

Alternatively, the device UUIDs and their corresponding authentication tokens can also be set through a file
`identities.json`. See example: [example_identities.json](main/config/example_identities.json)

## Run Client in Docker container

To get the latest multi-architecture image, check
the [releases](https://github.com/ubirch/ubirch-client-go/releases/latest)
and pull the latest release from Docker Hub using the release tag, e.g.:

```console
docker pull ubirch/ubirch-client:v2.2.3
```

To start the multi-arch Docker image on any system, run:

```console
docker run -v $(pwd):/data --network host ubirch/ubirch-client:v2.2.3
```

The configuration directory inside the docker container is `/data`. The docker image mounts the current
directory (`$(pwd)`) into the */data* path to load the configuration file (if configuration is not set via environment
variables), and the TLS certificate and key files (if TLS is enabled).

It is also possible to pass an absolute path instead of `$(pwd)`.

If the */data* path is not used for either configuration file, nor TLS cert files,
the `-v $(pwd):/data` parameter can be omitted.

## Interface Description

The UBIRCH client provides HTTP endpoints for both original data and direct hash injection, i.e. the SHA256 digest of
the original data. If the client receives original data, it will create a SHA256 hash before any further processing.

This means, UBIRCH will never see your original data. It also means that the original data will have to be stored
independently in order to be able to verify it later.

> When receiving a JSON data package, the UBIRCH client will sort the keys alphabetically and remove insignificant
> space characters before hashing.
>
> See [reproducibility of hashes](#reproducibility-of-hashes).

### Identity Registration

Sending a registration request invokes the generation of a ECDSA key pair for signing UPPs. On success, the response
contains an X.509 Certificate Signing Request in PEM format.

    curl ${host}/register -X PUT \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: ${registerAuth}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"uuid":${device_uuid}, "password":${password}}' \
    -i

The "password" is the [UBIRCH backend authentication token](#how-to-acquire-the-ubirch-backend-authentication-token).

### CSR Generation

A CSR for an already registered identity can be retrieved from the CSR endpoint.

    curl ${host}/${uuid}/csr -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: ${registerAuth}" \
    -i

### UPP Signing

Signing service endpoints require an authentication token, which corresponds to the `UUID` used in the request. The
token must be sent with the request header. Without it, the client will not accept the request.

| Request Header | Description |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `X-Auth-Token` | UBIRCH backend token related to `<UUID>` |

> See [how to acquire the UBIRCH backend token](#how-to-acquire-the-ubirch-backend-authentication-token).

#### Anchoring Hashes (chained)

| Method | Path | Content-Type | Description |
|--------|------|--------------|-------------|
| POST | `/<UUID>` | `application/octet-stream` | original data (binary) will be hashed, chained, signed, and anchored |
| POST | `/<UUID>` | `application/json` | original data (JSON data package) will be hashed, chained, signed, and anchored |
| POST | `/<UUID>/hash` | `application/octet-stream` | SHA256 hash (binary) will be chained, signed, and anchored |
| POST | `/<UUID>/hash` | `text/plain` | SHA256 hash (base64 string repr.) will be chained, signed, and anchored  |

#### Anchoring Hashes (no chain)

| Method | Path | Content-Type | Description |
|--------|------|--------------|-------------|
| POST | `/<UUID>/anchor` | `application/octet-stream` | original data (binary) will be hashed signed, and anchored |
| POST | `/<UUID>/anchor` | `application/json` | original data (JSON data package) will be hashed signed, and anchored |
| POST | `/<UUID>/anchor/hash` | `application/octet-stream` | SHA256 hash (binary) will be signed, and anchored |
| POST | `/<UUID>/anchor/hash` | `text/plain` | SHA256 hash (base64 string repr.) will be signed, and anchored |

#### Update Operations

Beside anchoring, the client can request hash update operations from the UBIRCH backend, i.e. `disable`, `enable`
and `delete`.

| Update Operation | Path (original data)| Path (hash) |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| disable | `/<UUID>/disable` | `/<UUID>/disable/hash` |
| enable  | `/<UUID>/enable`  | `/<UUID>/enable/hash`  |
| delete  | `/<UUID>/delete`  | `/<UUID>/delete/hash`  |

Hash update requests to the UBIRCH backend must come from the same UUID that anchored said hash and be signed by the
same private key that signed the anchoring request.

#### UPP Signing Response

Response codes indicate the successful delivery of the UPP to the UBIRCH backend. Any code other than `200` should be
considered a failure. The client does not retry itself. A good approach to handle errors is to add a flag to the
original data storage that indicates whether the UBIRCH blockchain anchoring was successful and retry at a later point
if necessary.

The response body consists of either an error message, or a JSON map with

- the data hash,
- the UPP, which contains that data hash and was sent to the UBIRCH backend by the client,
- the public key, that corresponds to the private key with which the UPP was signed,
- the response from the UBIRCH backend,
- the unique request ID
- *optional:* a description of an occurred error (**the `error`-key is only present in case an error occurred**)

```fundamental
{
  "hash": "<base64 encoded data hash>",
  "upp": "<base64 encoded UPP containing the data hash>",
  "publicKey": "<base64 encoded raw public key>",
  "response": {
    "statusCode": <backend response status code (int)>,
    "header": {<backend response header (map[string][]string)>},
    "content": "<base64 encoded backend response content>"
  },
  "requestID": "<request ID (standard hex string representation)>",
  "error": "error message"
}
```

> UPPs (such as the backend response content) are [MessagePack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md)
> formatted and can be decoded using an online tool
> like [this MessagePack to JSON Converter](https://toolslick.com/conversion/data/messagepack-to-json).

#### Error Codes

| HTTP response status code | orig. data | hash | description |

| 504 - Gateway Timeout | x | x | service was unable to produce a timely response |

Internally, the client sends a request to the UBIRCH authentication service (*Niomon*) and forwards its response back to
the sender (i.e. the `"response"`-filed in the JSON response body of the client). If no other errors occurred, the
client will adopt the HTTP response status code of the backend response.

### UPP Verification

Verification endpoints do not require an authentication token.

| Method | Path | Content-Type | Description |
|--------|------|--------------|-------------|
| POST | `/verify` | `application/octet-stream` | verify hash of original data (binary) |
| POST | `/verify` | `application/json` | verify hash of original data (JSON data package) |
| POST | `/verify/hash` | `application/octet-stream` | verify hash (binary) |
| POST | `/verify/hash` | `text/plain` | verify hash (base64 string repr.) |

#### UPP Verification Response

A `200` response code indicates the successful verification of the data in the UBIRCH backend as well as a local
verification of the validity of the retrieved UPP.

The response body consists of either an error message, or a JSON map with

- the requested data hash,
- the UPP, which contains the requested data hash and was retrieved from the UBIRCH backend by the client,
- the UUID of the device from which the data originated,
- the public key of that device, which was used to verify the signature of the retrieved UPP
- *possibly:* a description of an occurred error (**the `error`-key is only present in case an error occurred**)

```json
{
  "hash": "<base64 encoded requested data hash>",
  "upp": "<base64 encoded UPP containing the requested data hash",
  "uuid": "<standard hex string representation of the device UUID>",
  "pubKey": "<base64 encoded public key used for signature verification>",
  "error": "error message"
}
```

### Key De-/Re-Activation

A key can be de-activated ...

    curl ${host}/device/updateActive -X PUT \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: ${registerAuth}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":${device_uuid},"active":false}' \
    -i

... and re-activated .

    curl ${host}/device/updateActive -X PUT \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: ${registerAuth}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":${device_uuid},"active":true}' \
    -i

### TCP Address

The client exposes port `:8080` for HTTP requests. When running the client locally, the default base address is:

```fundamental
http://localhost:8080
```

(or `https://localhost:8080`, if TLS is enabled)

> See [how to set a different TCP address/port for the client](#set-tcp-address).

#### Example:

Here is an example of a request to the client using `CURL`.

- original data (JSON):
  ```console
  curl localhost:8080/<UUID> \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: <AUTH_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id": "605b91b4-49be-4f17-93e7-f1b14384968f", "ts": 1585838578, "data": "1234567890"}' \
    -i
  ```

- direct data hash injection:
  ```console
  curl localhost:8080/<UUID>/hash \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: <AUTH_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
    -d "bTawDQO7nnB+3h55/6VyQ+Tmd1RTV9R0cFcf7CRWzQQ=" \
    -i
  ```

### Uniqueness of hashes

Every anchored data hash, and therefore the data, **must be unique**. The UBIRCH backend will reject the request with
response code `409` if the same hash has been sent previously.

Uniqueness can be achieved by adding a UUID and timestamp to the data before hashing. For example:

```json
{
  "id": "605b91b4-49be-4f17-93e7-f1b14384968f",
  "ts": 1585838578,
  "data": "1234567890"
}
```

### Reproducibility of hashes

It is essential for the hashes to be reproducible in order to use them for verification of the data at a later time.
Since the JSON format is non-deterministic, we need to define rules for converting it to a binary representation before
calculating the hash.

If the client receives a JSON data package, it will generate a *sorted compact rendering* before calculating the hash,
i.e. it will first create a string representation of the JSON formatted data where the keys are in alphabetical order
and insignificant space characters were elided.

#### Example:

- JSON data package:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "605b91b4-49be-4f17-93e7-f1b14384968f",
      "ts": 1585838578,
      "data": {
          "T": "26.250",
          "H": "65"
      }
    }
    ```

## Optional Configurations

### Set the UBIRCH backend environment

The `env` configuration refers to the UBIRCH backend environment. The default value is `prod`, which is the production
environment. For development, the environment may be set to `demo`, which is a test system that works like the
production environment, but stores data only in a blockchain test net. __However, we suggest using `prod` in general as
`demo` may not always be available__.

> Note that the UUIDs must be registered at the according UBIRCH backend environment,
> i.e. https://console.demo.ubirch.com/.

To switch to the `demo` backend environment

- add the following key-value pair to your `config.json`:
    ```json
      "env": "demo"
    ```
- or set the following environment variable:
    ```shell
    UBIRCH_ENV=demo
    ```

### Customize X.509 Certificate Signing Requests

The client creates X.509 Certificate Signing Requests (*CSRs*) for the public keys of the devices it is managing. The *
Common Name* of the CSR subject is the UUID associated with the public key. The values for the *Organization* and *
Country* of the CSR subject can be set through the configuration.

- add the following key-value pairs to your `config.json`:
    ```json
      "CSR_country": "<CSR Subject Country Name (2 letter code)>",
      "CSR_organization": "<CSR Subject Organization Name (e.g. company)>"
    ```
- or set the following environment variables:
    ```shell
    UBIRCH_CSR_COUNTRY=<CSR Subject Country Name (2 letter code)>
    UBIRCH_CSR_ORGANIZATION=<CSR Subject Organization Name (e.g. company)>
    ```

### Set TCP address

You can specify the TCP address for the server to listen on, in the form `host:port`. If empty, port 8080 is used.

- add the following key-value pair to your `config.json`:
    ```json
      "TCP_addr": ":8080",
    ```
- or set the following environment variable:
    ```shell
    UBIRCH_TCP_ADDR=:8080
    ```

> This describes how to configure the TCP port *the client* exposes,
> **not the docker container**. If you are running the client in a docker container,
> you can configure the exposed TCP port (`<host_port>`) with the according
> argument when starting the client with `docker run`:
>
> `docker run -p <host_port>:8080 ubirch/ubirch-client:vx.x.x`
>
> See [Run Client in Docker container](#run-client-in-docker-container)

### Enable TLS (serve HTTPS)

1. Create a self-signed TLS certificate

   In order to serve HTTPS endpoints, you can run the following command to create a self-signed certificate with
   openssl. With this command it will be valid for ten years.
    ```console
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -nodes -out cert.pem -days 3650
    ```

2. Enable TLS in configuration

    - add the following key-value pair to your `config.json`:
        ```json
          "TLS": true
        ```
    - or set the following environment variable:
        ```shell
        UBIRCH_TLS=true
         ```

3. Set path and filename (optional)

   By default, client will look for the `key.pem` and `cert.pem` files in the working directory
   (same location as the config file), but it is possible to define a different location (relative to the working
   directory) and/or filename by adding them to your configuration file.

    - add the following key-value pairs to your `config.json`:
        ```json
          "TLSCertFile": "<path/to/TLS-cert-filename>",
          "TLSKeyFile": "<path/to/TLS-key-filename>"
        ```
    - or set the following environment variables:
        ```shell
        UBIRCH_TLS_CERTFILE=certs/cert.pem
        UBIRCH_TLS_KEYFILE=certs/key.pem
        ```

### Enable Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

**Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can only be enabled if the UBIRCH backend environment is set to `demo`
and will be ignored on production stage.**
> [See how to set the UBIRCH backend environment](#set-the-ubirch-backend-environment)

To enable CORS and configure a list of *allowed origins*, i.e. origins a cross-domain request can be executed from,

- add the following key-value pairs to your `config.json`:
    ```json
      "CORS": true,
      "CORS_origins": ["<allowed origin>"]
    ```
- or set the following environment variables:
    ```shell
    UBIRCH_CORS=true
    UBIRCH_CORS_ORIGINS=<allowed origin>
    ```

An origin may contain a wildcard (`*`) to replace 0 or more characters (e.g.: `http://*.domain.com`). Only one wildcard
can be used per origin.

Setting *allowed origins* is optional. If CORS is enabled, but no *allowed origins* are specified, the default value
is `["*"]`
which means, **all** origins will be allowed.

### Extended Debug Output

To set the logging level to `debug` and so enable extended debug output,

- add the following key-value pair to your `config.json`:
    ```json
      "debug": true
    ```
- or set the following environment variable:
    ```shell
    UBIRCH_DEBUG=true
    ```

### Log Format

By default, the log of the client is in JSON format. To change it to a (more human-eye-friendly) text format,

- add the following key-value pairs to your `config.json`:
    ```json
      "logTextFormat": true
    ```
- or set the following environment variables:
    ```shell
    UBIRCH_LOGTEXTFORMAT=true
    ```

## Quick Start

1. Configuration

   First, you will need a device UUID, that is registered with the UBIRCH backend, and a corresponding auth token for
   that device. You will also need a secret to encrypt the locally stored private keys:
    1. Generate a UUID for your device. On Linux/macOS, simply enter `uuidgen` in your terminal. Alternatively, you can
       use an [online tool](https://www.uuidtools.com/v4).
    2. Get your auth token:
        - Create an account at the [**UBIRCH web UI**](https://console.prod.ubirch.com/) and log in.
        - Go to **Things** (in the menu on the left) and click the green `+ ADD NEW DEVICE`-button.
        - Enter your UUID to the **ID** field and, optionally, a description. Then click on `register`.
        - After successful registration, you can click on your UUID to open the settings and copy the **"password"**
          from the `apiConfig` as your auth token.
    3. Generate a 16 byte secret in base64 format. You can enter `head -c 16 /dev/urandom | base64` in a Linux/macOS
       terminal or encode 16 ASCII characters in an [online base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/).

   Create a file `config.json` in your working directory with the following content:
    ```json
    {
      "devices": {
        "<YOUR_UUID>": "<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>"
      },
      "secret": "<YOUR_16_BYTE_SECRET(base64 encoded)>",
      "logTextFormat": true
    }
    ```
    - Replace `<YOUR_UUID>` with your UUID from step 1.1.
    - Replace `<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>` with your auth token from step 1.2.
    - Replace `<YOUR_16_BYTE_SECRET(base64 encoded)>` with your secret from step 1.3.
   > [Here](main/config/example_config.json) is an example of how it should look like.

2. Run the client

   To run the dockerized UBIRCH client, you will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) installed on your
   computer. Then enter the following two lines in the terminal in your working directory:
    ```console
    docker pull ubirch/ubirch-client:v1.2.2
    docker run -v $(pwd):/data -p 8080:8080 ubirch/ubirch-client:v1.2.2
    ```

   When the client is first started, it will create an ECDSA key pair for your device and register the public key at the
   UBIRCH backend.

   You should see a console output like this:
    ```console
    {"level":"info","msg":"UBIRCH client (v2.0.0, build=local)","time":"2021-03-01T18:41:20+01:00"}
    {"level":"info","msg":"loading configuration from file: config.json","time":"2021-03-01T18:41:20+01:00"}
    INFO[2021-03-01 18:41:20.291 +0100] 1 known UUID(s)
    INFO[2021-03-01 18:41:20.291 +0100] UBIRCH backend environment: prod
    INFO[2021-03-01 18:41:20.291 +0100] protocol context will be stored in local file system
    INFO[2021-03-01 18:41:20.291 +0100] generating new key pair for UUID 50b1a5bb-83cd-4251-b674-b3c71a058fc3
    INFO[2021-03-01 18:41:20.664 +0100] 50b1a5bb-83cd-4251-b674-b3c71a058fc3: registering public key at key service: https://key.prod.ubirch.com/api/keyService/v1/pubkey
    INFO[2021-03-01 18:41:21.755 +0100] 50b1a5bb-83cd-4251-b674-b3c71a058fc3: submitting CSR to identity service: https://identity.prod.ubirch.com/api/certs/v1/csr/register
    INFO[2021-03-01 18:41:22.130 +0100] starting HTTP service
    ```
   That means the client is running and ready!

   ---
   **WARNING**

   The client stores the encrypted signing keys in a local file `keys.json`, which will be created in the
   working directory upon first start-up. **Do not delete this file**, as our backend will not accept new key
   registrations once a device already has a registered key.

   The client also creates a subdirectory `/signatures`, which contains the previous UPP signatures for chaining.
    
   ---

3. Seal your data

   The client is now listening for HTTP requests on port `8080`. You can either...
    - send JSON data to the `/<UUID>`-endpoint with `Content-Type: application/json`-header, or
    - send hashes to the `/<UUID>/hash`-endpoint with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`-header.

   Since the data hash for every UPP must be unique, ensure that the body of each request has a unique content. You can
   do that, for example, by adding an ID and a timestamp to the JSON data package. For more information
   see [Uniqueness of hashes](#Uniqueness-of-hashes).

   **Floating-point numbers and integers greater than 2<sup>53</sup> are not allowed as values for the JSON data
   package!**

   You also need to set the `X-Auth-Token`-header with your UBIRCH backend auth token from step 1.

   Here is an example of how a request to the client would look like using `CURL`:
   ```console
   curl localhost:8080/<YOUR_UUID> \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id": "50b1a5bb-83cd-4251-b674-b3c71a058fc3", "ts": 1614621028, "data": "1234567890"}' \
    -i -s
   ```

   > Insert `<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>` and `<YOUR_UUID>` and a request body with your own unique content to ensure a unique
   hash!

   When the client receives a request, it hashes the data from the request body and creates a chained Ubirch Protocol
   Package (UPP) with the data hash as payload. The UPP will be signed with the private key of the device and sent to
   the UBIRCH backend. There, the signature will be verified with the previously registered public key.

   The output should look like this:
    ```console
    INFO[2021-03-01 18:52:59.471 +0100] 50b1a5bb-83cd-4251-b674-b3c71a058fc3: anchoring hash: CDUvtOIBnnZ8im/UXQn5G/q5EK9l2Bqy+HyMgSzPZoA=
    INFO[2021-03-01 18:53:00.313 +0100] 50b1a5bb-83cd-4251-b674-b3c71a058fc3: request ID: 0f11686e-aee3-4e97-8d0d-793a0c31d969
    ```
   Take note of the hash!

   If your request was submitted, you'll get a `200` response code.

   The HTTP response body is a JSON map. It contains the data hash, the UPP, which was created by the client and sent
   to the UBIRCH backend, and the UBIRCH backend response. The content of the UBIRCH backend response is a
   UPP as well. UPPs are in *MessagePack* format (base64 encoded) and can be decoded using, for example,
   this [MessagePack to JSON Converter](https://toolslick.com/conversion/data/messagepack-to-json). You can read more
   about UPPs [here](https://developer.ubirch.com/utp).

   ```json
    {
        "hash": "CDUvtOIBnnZ8im/UXQn5G/q5EK9l2Bqy+HyMgSzPZoA=",
        "upp": "liPEEFCxpbuDzUJRtnSzxxoFj8PEQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxCAINS+04gGednyKb9RdCfkb+rkQr2XYGrL4fIyBLM9mgMRAIVlhgxobRl7ApJerXUyJ5cBxBJJ7gwPUN9AKgKJWxAxkWMWufRp8jW9Ha79s5hYbNp9+bn94cMflWyAyyjy4Ew==",
        "response": {
            "statusCode": 200,
            "header": {
                "Content-Length": [
                    "187"
                ],
                "Content-Type": [
                    "application/octet-stream"
                ],
                "Date": [
                    "Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:53:00 GMT"
                ],
                "Server": [
                    "ubirch-trust-service/1.0"
                ]
            },
            "content": "liPEEJ08eP8i80RBpdGFxjbUhv/EQCFZYYMaG0ZewKSXq11MieXAcQSSe4MD1DfQCoCiVsQMZFjFrn0afI1vR2u/bOYWGzaffm5/eHDH5VsgMso8uBMAxCAPEWhuruNOl40NeToMMdlpAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMRA+IFgAugN6CY1xPSch1TwhFdac8yRA1QhPRXOhUt7rudrwrNv0NAEJGlLw1wUSpcSLmBFQaoRb9EezmYxmtF7iA=="
        },
        "requestID": "0f11686e-aee3-4e97-8d0d-793a0c31d969"
    }
   ```
   If you get a response code other than `200`, it means that something went wrong. In this case the client will respond
   with an error message. You can also find error messages in the console output of the client.

4. To stop the client, press `ctrl` + `c`.

## Verification

You should now be able to see that your UPP was received and verified by the UBIRCH backend under
[Your Things](https://console.prod.ubirch.com/devices/list) in the UBIRCH web UI.

To look at the anchoring of your data hash in public blockchains, go to the
[UBIRCH web UI verification page](https://console.prod.ubirch.com/verification/graph)
and enter your data hash in the search field.

It is also possible to verify the hash using the API by sending a POST request with the hash you wish to verify to the
UBIRCH verification service:

```fundamental
https://verify.prod.ubirch.com/api/upp/verify/anchor
```

> e.g. `curl -d '<YOUR_HASH>' https://verify.prod.ubirch.com/api/upp/verify/anchor`

This endpoint checks if the *UPP*, which contains the data hash has arrived correctly and was verifiable, gives
information about the chain (*prev*ious UPP) as well as blockchain info on the time frame (the upper and lower bounds)
when the data was received, i.e. the closest blockchain transactions before and after the data was received by the
UBIRCH backend (*anchors*).

If the verification was successful, the service will send a *200* response with a JSON formatted body like this:

```json
{
  "upp": "liPEEJnqh/TPxEVni9ELTBXq9V7EQGOMAcwCV4rbHGZT+A8sd2DOpRB2mdUyZSSg7wB5hYNix5CszzbhRksmDTP/mADH1EBEPnUgfXbo6Y6dbFBL6CgAxCAy+oS7kDq+fc74gcKSX1UsG0iuOx5iwkW/MyED7Df9PcRAQ9hNm3gkM5vyeIX8zwI+7D/VbsgpLV5o4oYLFo7FilA8Urj5ELQNrC0PKYKco0LoC7xNbVoIhrvOnLNZVyme3w==",

        "hash": "CAGRDRTQBNNHHQONUHBMWPHMUTMCYJ9XNKJJNTHMBUZXYKEUKTERIFMNNFBKWUAMAMXERJBQQFNQWA999",

        "type": "PUBLIC_CHAIN"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> Note that the first UPP to be anchored will not have a 'previous' package to be chained to. The `"prev"` value will
> therefore be `null`.

It can take up to **10 minutes** before the anchoring in public blockchains can be verified, but there is also an
endpoint for a quick check, that verifies that the hash was received by the UBIRCH backend:

```fundamental
https://verify.prod.ubirch.com/api/upp
```

... and another endpoint, which additionally checks the chain:

```fundamental
https://verify.prod.ubirch.com/api/upp/verify
```

A *404* response with an empty body means the hash could not be verified (yet).
