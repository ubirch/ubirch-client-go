# UBIRCH client (go)

The UBIRCH client provides signature and chaining services to seal original data generated on-premise. It takes care of
 packaging the hashed data into a chained *UBIRCH PROTOCOL PACKET ("UPP")*, signing the package and sending it to the 
 UBIRCH backend for storage, anchoring in the blockchain, and as a source for verification requests.
 
*The original data must be stored in a customer database to be able to execute verification requests at a later stage.
 UBIRCH does not store any original sensitive data!*
 
UPP data is sent to the UBIRCH client via HTTP requests. The client can receive either the original data as a JSON data
 package which will be formatted and hashed (SHA256) by the client, or the binary representation of a SHA256 hash that 
 is directly added as payload to the UPP.
 
The UBIRCH client stores its signing keys and the signature of the last UPP persistently to ensure an intact chain
 after a restart.

 ---
 **WARNING**
 
Per default, the client creates a file `protocol.json` in the working directory, where it stores the encrypted
signing keys and last signatures for chaining. **Do not delete this file** as our backend will not accept new key
registrations once a device already has a registered key.

## Dockerized UBIRCH client
The UBIRCH client is provided as a docker image that can be configured and run on any system that can run docker (Intel/AMD64 or ARM64 architecture).
 
Docker Hub Address: [ubirch/ubirch-client](https://hub.docker.com/r/ubirch/ubirch-client) (multi-architecture image)

[Jump to Quick Start](#quick-start)

### Requirements
- System based on Intel/AMD64 or ARM
- Docker installation
- Space to store last used signatures and key material, either:
    - disk space, mounted into the docker pod, or 
    - as SQL database
- Possibility to send a HTTP request to UBIRCH.com domains
- A unique identifier (UUID) registered with the UBIRCH console
- A corresponding authentication token (acquired via UBIRCH console)
- A password for the client’s key store
- (OPTIONAL) a private ECDSA (ecdsa-prime256v1) key
    *(otherwise a new key is generated by the client itself)*
    
## Building
There are multiple make targets, to simplify the building process.
```shell
make all       # create all available artifacts
make binaries  # create all supported binaries
make pack      # compresses the binaries to be much smaller (requires UPX installation)
make docker    # create docker images for amd64 armv7 and arm64
make dockerhub # publish a combined multi-arch image on the dockerhub
               # takes DOCKER_TAG= to specify a tag name, and DOCKER_TAG_LATEST=(true/false)
               # if the 'latest' tag should be updated or not.
make images    # create images as artifacts (.tar)
make clean     # delete all artifacts
```
Compiled artifacts will be saved to the `build/` directory.

```shell script
make dockerhub DOCKER_TAG=v1.0.0 # will tag a multi-arch image with the selected tag and upload it
                                 # to the dockerhub.
```

## Configuration
The client may be configured using a configuration file (`config.json`) or by using environment variables
 that can be passed to the docker executable.

The client is able to handle multiple cryptographic identities (i.e. for multiple LAN based devices). The UUIDs for
 these devices must be declared in the configuration file together with their respective authentication token. Only
 requests from *known* UUIDs will be accepted by the client.

The client will first look if the `UBIRCH_SECRET` env variable exists and load the configuration from the environment
 variables in that case. If the `UBIRCH_SECRET` env variable is not set or empty, and the `config.json`-file exists in 
 the working directory, the configuration will be loaded from the file. If neither exist, the client will abort and exit.
 
The only two mandatory configurations are 
- the `devices`-map, which maps device UUIDs to their authentication token
    > - A UUID can be generated in a Linux terminal with the `uuidgen` command
    > - See [how to acquire the authentication token](#how-to-acquire-the-ubirch-backend-token)
- the 16 byte base64 encoded `secret`, which is used to encrypt the key store.
    > Quickly generate a random 16 byte base64 encoded secret in a Linux terminal with `head -c 16 /dev/urandom | base64`

### File Based Configuration 
`config.json`:
```json
{
  "devices": {
    "<UUID>": "<ubirch backend auth token>"
  },
  "secret": "<16 byte secret used to encrypt the key store (base64 encoded)>"
}
```
(See [example_config.json](main/example_config.json) for an example.)

### Environment Based Configuration
```
UBIRCH_DEVICES=<UUID>:<ubirch backend auth token>
UBIRCH_SECRET=<16 byte secret used to encrypt the key store (base64 encoded)>
```
(See [example.env](main/example.env) for an example.)
 
 All other configuration parameters have default values, but can be configured as follows.

### Set the UBIRCH backend environment
The `env` configuration refers to the UBIRCH backend environment. The default value is `prod`, which is the
production environment. For development, the environment may be set to `demo`, which is a test system
that works like the production environment, but stores data only in a blockchain test net.

> Note that the UUIDs must be registered at the according UBIRCH backend environment.

To switch to the `demo` backend environment
- add the following key-value pair to your `config.json`:
```
  "env": "demo"
```
- or set the following environment variable:
```
UBIRCH_ENV=demo
```
 
### Use a SQL database to store the protocol context
The `DSN` (*Data Source Name*) can be used to connect the client to a SQL database for storing the protocol context 
(i.e. the encrypted keystore and last signatures) persistently. If DSN is not set or empty, the 
client will create a file `protocol.json` (and `protocol.json.bck`) locally in the working directory.

If you want to use a SQL database instead of a local file, make sure to apply the 
[database schema](main/schema.sql), as the application will not create it itself on first run, and 
set the DSN in the configuration.

- add the following key-value pair to your `config.json`:
```
  "DSN": "<data source name for database>"
```
- or set the following environment variable:
```
UBIRCH_DSN=<data source name for database>
```

### Inject signing keys
The `staticKeys`-flag may be used to disable dynamic key generation and only accept requests from UUIDs with injected
signing key. The default value for this flag is `false`, which means the client will per default generate a new ECDSA
(prime256v1) key pair if it receives a request from a UUID without a corresponding signing key in the keystore.

Instead of having the client generate keys dynamically it is possible to inject signing keys as a map UUID to signing key.

- add the following key-value pairs to your `config.json`:
```
  "staticKeys": <boolean, defaults to ‘false’>,
  "keys": {"<UUID>": "<ecdsa-prime256v1 private key (base64 encoded)>"}
```
- or set the following environment variables:
```
UBIRCH_STATICKEYS=<boolean, defaults to ‘false’>
UBIRCH_KEYS=<UUID>:<ecdsa-prime256v1 private key (base64 encoded)>
```

> ECDSA signing keys (prime256v1) can be generated on the command line using openssl:
```console
$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout | openssl ec -text -noout | grep priv -A 3 | tail -n +2 | tr -d ': ' | xxd -r -p | base64
```

*Either way (dynamically generated or injected) the client will register the public key at the UBIRCH key service and
store the keys persistently in the encrypted keystore.*
 
### X.509 Certificate Signing Requests
The client creates X.509 Certificate Signing Requests (*CSRs*) for the public keys of the devices it is managing.
The *Common Name* of the CSR subject is the UUID associated with the public key.
The values for the *Organization* and *Country* of the CSR subject can be set through the configuration.

- add the following key-value pairs to your `config.json`:
```
  "CSR_country": "<CSR Subject Country Name (2 letter code)>",
  "CSR_organization": "<CSR Subject Organization Name (e.g. company)>"
```
- or set the following environment variables:
```
UBIRCH_CSR_COUNTRY=<CSR Subject Country Name (2 letter code)>
UBIRCH_CSR_ORGANIZATION=<CSR Subject Organization Name (e.g. company)>
```

### Set TCP address
You can specify the TCP address for the server to listen on, in the form `host:port`. 
If empty, port 8080 is used.

- add the following key-value pair to your `config.json`:
```
  "TCP_addr": ":8080",
```
- or set the following environment variable:
```
UBIRCH_TCP_ADDR=:8080
```

> This describes how to configure the TCP port *the client* exposes, 
> **not the docker container**. If you are running the client in a docker container, 
> you can configure the exposed TCP port (`<host_port>`) with the according
> argument when starting the client with `docker run`:
>
> `$ docker run -p <host_port>:8080 ubirch/ubirch-client:stable`
>
> See [Run Client in Docker container](#run-client-in-docker-container)
 
### Enable TLS (serve HTTPS)
- Create a self-signed TLS certificate

    In order to serve HTTPS endpoints, you can run the following command to create a self-signed certificate with openssl.
     With this command it will be valid for ten years.
    ```console
    $ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -nodes -out cert.pem -days 3650
    ``` 

- Enable TLS in configuration

    To serve HTTPS requests to the UBIRCH client service, add the following key-value pair to your `config.json`:
    ```
      "TLS": true
    ```
    ...or set the following environment variable:
    ```
    UBIRCH_TLS=true
    ```

By default, client will look for the `key.pem` and `cert.pem` files in the working directory 
(same location as the config file), but you can define a different location (relative to the working 
directory) and/or filename by adding them to your configuration file like this:
```
  "TLSCertFile": "<path/to/TLS-cert-filename>",
  "TLSKeyFile": "<path/to/TLS-key-filename>"
```
...or if you are using environment based configuration:
```
UBIRCH_TLS_CERTFILE=certs/cert.pem
UBIRCH_TLS_KEYFILE=certs/key.pem
```

### Enable Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
**Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can only be enabled if the UBIRCH backend environment is set to `demo`
 and will be ignored on production stage.**
> [See how to set the UBIRCH backend environment](#set-the-ubirch-backend-environment)

To enable CORS and configure a list of *allowed origins*, i.e. origins a cross-domain request can be executed from,
 add the following key-value pair to your `config.json`:
```
  "CORS": true,
  "CORS_origins": ["<allowed origin>"]
```
or set the following environment variable:
```
UBIRCH_CORS=true
UBIRCH_CORS_ORIGINS=<allowed origin>
```

An origin may contain a wildcard (`*`) to replace 0 or more characters (e.g.: `http://*.domain.com`). 
Only one wildcard can be used per origin. 

Setting *allowed origins* is optional. If CORS is enabled, but no *allowed origins* are specified, the default value is `["*"]` 
which means, **all** origins will be allowed. 

### Extended Debug Output
To set the logging level to `debug` and so enable extended debug output
 add the following key-value pair to your `config.json`:
```
  "debug": true
```
or set the following environment variable:
```
UBIRCH_DEBUG=true
```

### How to acquire the ubirch backend token
- Register at the **UBIRCH web UI**: 
    
    Depending on the UBIRCH backend environment you are using, go to
    - **`prod`: https://console.prod.ubirch.com/**
    - `demo`: https://console.demo.ubirch.com/
- Go to **Things** (in the menu on the left) and click on `+ ADD NEW DEVICE`
- Enter your device UUID to the **ID** field. You can also add a description for your device, if you want. Then click on `register`. 
- Your device should now show up under **Your Things**-overview. Click on it and copy the "password" (which looks like a UUID) as the ubirch backend token.

## Run Client in Docker container
To start the multi-arch Docker image on any system, run:
```console
$ docker pull ubirch/ubirch-client:stable
$ docker run -v $(pwd):/data -p <host_port>:8080 ubirch/ubirch-client:stable
```
> replace `<host_port>` with the desired TCP network port on the host (e.g. `-p 8080:8080`)

The default configuration directory inside the docker container is `/data`.
The docker image mounts the current directory (`$(pwd)`) into the */data* path to 
load the configuration file (if configuration is not set via environment variables), 
and the TLS certificate and key files (if TLS is enabled). 
If no DSN (database) is set in the configuration, the image stores the protocol context 
(i.e. keystore and last signatures) in this directory as well, 
in which case the directory must be writable. 

It is also possible to pass an absolute path instead of `$(pwd)`.

If the */data* path is not used for either configuration file, TLS cert files, or to store the protocol context, 
the `-v $(pwd):/data` parameter can be omitted.

## Interface Description
The UBIRCH client provides HTTP endpoints for both original data, which will be hashed by the client,
 and direct data hash injection, i.e. the SHA256 digest of the original data.

| Method | Path | Content-Type | Description |
|--------|------|--------------|-------------|
| POST | `/<UUID>` | `application/octet-stream` | original data (binary) |
| POST | `/<UUID>` | `application/json` | original data (JSON data package) |
| POST | `/<UUID>/hash` | `application/octet-stream` | hash (binary) |
| POST | `/<UUID>/hash` | `text/plain` | hash (base64 string repr.) |
> When receiving a JSON data package, the UBIRCH client will sort the keys alphabetically and remove insignificant
> space characters before hashing. 
>
> See [reproducibility of hashes](#reproducibility-of-hashes).

To access either endpoint an authentication token, which corresponds to the `UUID` used in the request,
 must be sent with the request header. Without it, the client won’t accept the request:

| `X-Auth-Token` | `ubirch backend token related to <UUID>` |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------| 

> See [how to acquire the ubirch backend token](#how-to-acquire-the-ubirch-backend-token).

#### TCP Address
When running the client locally, the default address is:
    
    localhost:8080/<UUID>

(or `https://localhost:8080/<UUID>` if TLS is enabled)

> See [how to set a different TCP address/port for the client](#set-tcp-address).

#### Example
Here is an example of a request to the client using `CURL`.

- original data (JSON):
  ```
  curl localhost:8080/<UUID> \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: <AUTH_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id": "605b91b4-49be-4f17-93e7-f1b14384968f", "ts": 1585838578, "data": "1234567890"}' \
    -i
  ```

- direct data hash injection:
  ```
  curl localhost:8080/<UUID>/hash \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: <AUTH_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
    -d "bTawDQO7nnB+3h55/6VyQ+Tmd1RTV9R0cFcf7CRWzQQ=" \
    -i
  ```

#### Response
Response codes indicate the successful delivery of the UPP to the UBIRCH backend.
 Any code other than `200` should be considered a failure. The client does not retry itself.
 A good approach to handle errors is to add a flag to the original data storage that indicates whether the
 UBIRCH blockchain anchoring was successful and retry at a later point if necessary.
 
The response body contains either an error message, or a JSON map with the anchored data hash, 
the UPP, which contains that data hash and was sent to the UBIRCH backend, 
as well as the response from the UBIRCH backend, which is also a UPP:
```json
{
  "hash": "<the base64 encoded data hash>",
  "upp": "<the base64 encoded UPP containing the data hash that was sent to the ubirch backend by the client>",
  "response": "<the base64 encoded backend response (UPP)>"
}
```
> UPPs (such as the backend response) are [MessagePack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md) formatted
> and can be decoded using an online tool like [this MessagePack to JSON Converter](https://toolslick.com/conversion/data/messagepack-to-json).

### Verification endpoints
The UBIRCH client also provides verification endpoints for original data and hashes.

| Method | Path | Content-Type | Description |
|--------|------|--------------|-------------|
| POST | `/verify` | `application/octet-stream` | original data (binary) |
| POST | `/verify` | `application/json` | original data (JSON data package) |
| POST | `/verify/hash` | `application/octet-stream` | hash (binary) |
| POST | `/verify/hash` | `text/plain` | hash (base64 string repr.) |

There is no authentication token necessary to access the verification endpoints.

A `200` response code indicates the successful verification of the data in the UBIRCH backend as well as a local 
verification of the validity of the retrieved UPP.
 
The response body contains either an error message, or a JSON map with the requested data hash, 
the UPP, which contains that data hash and was retrieved from the UBIRCH backend, 
as well as the UUID of the device from which the data originated:
```json
{
  "hash": "<the base64 encoded requested data hash>",
  "upp": "<the base64 encoded UPP containing the requested data hash that was retrieved from the ubirch backend by the client>",
  "uuid": "<the standard string representation of the device UUID>"
}
```

### Uniqueness of hashes
Every anchored data hash, and therefore the data, **must be unique**. 
The UBIRCH backend will reject the request with response code `409` if the same hash has been sent previously.

Uniqueness can be achieved by adding a UUID and timestamp to the data before hashing. For example:
```json
{"id": "605b91b4-49be-4f17-93e7-f1b14384968f", "ts": 1585838578, "data": "1234567890"}
```

### Reproducibility of hashes
It is essential for the hashes to be reproducible in order to use them for verification of the data at a later time.
Since the JSON format is non-deterministic, we need to define rules for converting it to a binary representation 
before calculating the hash.
 
If the client receives a JSON data package, it will generate a *sorted compact rendering* before calculating
 the hash, i.e. it will first create a string representation of the JSON formatted data where the keys 
 are in alphabetical order and insignificant space characters were elided.
 
##### Example:
- JSON data package:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "605b91b4-49be-4f17-93e7-f1b14384968f",
      "ts": 1585838578,
      "data": {
          "T": "26.250",
          "H": "65"
      }
    }
    ```
- sorted compact rendering (string):
    ```
    {"data":{"H":"65","T":"26.250"},"id":"605b91b4-49be-4f17-93e7-f1b14384968f","ts":1585838578}
    ```
- SHA256 digest (base64):
    ```
    uVXpb1vR8UlQnow/FoIcNbvcJ5bY1r2B+DZwe8AYSkE=
    ```

> **Floating-point numbers and integers greater than 2<sup>53</sup> are not allowed as values for the JSON data package!**
>
> If you need to sign floating-point numbers or numbers greater than *9,007,199,254,740,992*, you can pass the string representation, e.g.
> ```json
> {
>   "float": "5.321",
>   "bigNum": "9007199254740993"
> }
> ```

## Quick Start
1. First, you will need a device UUID, an auth token, and a 16 byte secret:
    1. Generate a UUID. On Linux simply enter `uuidgen` in your terminal. Alternatively, you can use an online tool.
    2. Get your auth token from the [UBIRCH web UI](https://console.prod.ubirch.com/):
        - Login or register if you don't have an account yet.
        - Go to **Things** and click on `+ ADD NEW DEVICE`.
        - Enter your UUID to the **ID** field, add a description for your device and click on `register`.
        - Click on your device in the overview and copy the value of the **"password"** from the `apiConfig` as your auth token.
    3. To encrypt the locally stored keys, we need a 16 byte secret in base64 format. 
    You can enter `head -c 16 /dev/urandom | base64` in a Linux terminal 
    or encode 16 ASCII characters in an online base64 converter.

1. Create a file `config.json` in your desired working directory with the following content:
    ```json
    {
      "devices": {
        "<YOUR_UUID>": "<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>"
      },
      "secret": "<YOUR_16_BYTE_SECRET(base64 encoded)>"
    }
    ```
    - Replace `<YOUR_UUID>` with your UUID from step 1.i.
    - Replace `<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>` with your auth token from step 1.ii.
    - Replace `<YOUR_16_BYTE_SECRET(base64 encoded)>` with your secret from step 1.iii.
    > Make sure you leave the quotes! [Here](main/example_config.json) is an example of how it should look like.

1. To run the dockerized UBIRCH client, you will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) installed on your computer. 
Then just enter the following two lines in your working directory:
    ```console
    $ docker pull ubirch/ubirch-client:stable
    $ docker run -v $(pwd):/data -p 8080:8080 ubirch/ubirch-client:stable
    ```
    You should see a console output like this:
    ```
    INFO[2020-06-30 12:16:30.977 +0200] UBIRCH client (v2.0.0, build=local)
    INFO[2020-06-30 12:16:30.977 +0200] loading configuration from file (config.json)

    INFO[2020-06-30 12:16:32.842 +0200] starting HTTP service
    
    ```
    That means the client is running and ready!
    
1. The client is now listening for HTTP POST requests on port `8080`. You can either...
   - send JSON data to the `/<UUID>`-endpoint with `Content-Type: application/json`-header, or 
   - send hashes to the `/<UUID>/hash`-endpoint with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`-header. 
   
   Also, set the `X-Auth-Token`-header with your ubirch backend auth token.
   
   Since the data hash for every UPP must be unique, ensure that the body of each request has a unique content. You can 
   do that, for example, by adding an ID and a timestamp to the JSON data package.
   
   **Floating-point numbers and integers greater than 2<sup>53</sup> are not allowed as values for the JSON data package!**

   Here is an example of how a request to the client would look like using `CURL`:
   ```
   curl -H "X-Auth-Token: <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": "605b91b4-49be-4f17-93e7-f1b14384968f", "ts": 1585838578, "data": "1234567890"}' localhost:8080/<YOUR_UUID> -i -s
   ```
   > Insert `<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>` and `<YOUR_UUID>` and a request body with your own unique content to ensure a unique hash!
   
   When the client receives the request, the output should look like this:
   ```
   INFO[2020-06-30 12:17:31.584 +0200] 8a70ad8b-a564-4e58-9a3b-224ac0f0153f: signing hash: bTawDQO7nnB+3h55/6VyQ+Tmd1RTV9R0cFcf7CRWzQQ=
   ```
   > Take note of the hash!
   
   If your request was submitted, you'll get a `200` response code.
   
   The HTTP response body from the client is a JSON map containing the data hash and the UPP, that has been sent 
   to the UBIRCH backend, and the response from the backend, which is a UPP as well. UPPs are in *MessagePack* format.
   
   ```json
    {

   If you get a response code other than `200`, it means that something went wrong. To check the error message,
   decode the `"response"`-UPP from the backend using the [MessagePack to JSON Converter](https://toolslick.com/conversion/data/messagepack-to-json).
   
1. To stop the client, press `ctrl` + `c`.
   
## Verification
You should now be able to see that your UPP was received and verified by the UBIRCH backend under 
[Your Things](https://console.prod.ubirch.com/devices/list) in the UBIRCH web UI.

To look at the anchoring of your data hash in public blockchains, go to the 
[UBIRCH web UI verification page](https://console.prod.ubirch.com/verification/graph) 
and enter your data hash in the search field.

It is also possible to verify the hash using the API by sending a POST request
with the hash you wish to verify to the UBIRCH verification service:
```
https://verify.prod.ubirch.com/api/upp/verify/anchor
```
> e.g. `curl -d '<YOUR_HASH>' https://verify.demo.ubirch.com/api/upp/verify/anchor`

This endpoint checks if the *UPP*, which contains the data hash has arrived correctly and was verifiable, 
gives information about the chain (*prev*ious UPP) as well as blockchain info on the time frame (the upper 
and lower bounds) when the data was received, i.e. the closest blockchain transactions before and after the 
data was received by the UBIRCH backend (*anchors*).

If the verification was successful, the service will send a *200* response with a JSON formatted body like this:
```json

    }

}
```
> Note that the first UPP to be anchored will not have a 'previous' package to be chained to. The `"prev"` value will therefore be `null`.

It can take up to **10 minutes** before the anchoring in public blockchains can be verified, 
but there is also an endpoint for a quick check, that verifies that the hash was received by the UBIRCH backend:
```
https://verify.demo.ubirch.com/api/upp
```
... and another endpoint, which additionally checks the chain:
```
https://verify.demo.ubirch.com/api/upp/verify
```

A *404* response with an empty body means the hash could not be verified (yet).
